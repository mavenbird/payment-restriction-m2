        Here and below:
        to run 7 tests related to payment methods, it is necessary to add test credentials for needed methods at (for Composer based installs)
        /magento/vendor/mavenbird/module-common-tests/Test/Mftf/Data/PaymentMethodsCredentialsData
        or (for install-by-upload)
        /magento/app/code/Mavenbird/CommonTests/Test/Mftf/Data/PaymentMethodsCredentialsData

        (!) Please note that due to test framework limitations it is currently impossible to revert payment methods configuration to pre-test-run condition.
        To avoid cases where live Magento instances may end up with test/sandbox payment methods mode after running tests, online payment method configuration parts (such as API Username/Password, Merchant ID, etc) will be emptied after its tests run.
        Please make sure that all relevant details are at hand prior to running this group of tests (and/or particular tests from it) at live instances.
